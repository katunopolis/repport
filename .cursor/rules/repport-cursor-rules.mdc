# Instructions for Cursor AI:

## Follow clean code principles:
### Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
### Keep functions short and focused (ideally < 50 lines)
### Minimize nesting and use early returns where possible
## Do not exceed 500 lines in code files
## Split code into logical modules/functions
## Group related functionality into separate files if needed (e.g., routes, services, config)
## Comment code generously to improve readability and maintainability
## Never hardcode secrets or passwords; use environment variables instead

## Security Best Practices:
### Sanitize and validate all user input (especially in APIs or forms)
### Use HTTPS for all deployments and local development (when applicable)
### Keep dependencies up to date and pin versions in requirements.txt or package.json

## Testing Guidelines:
### Write tests for core functionality (use Pytest for Python, Jest/RTL for React)
### Keep unit tests isolated; avoid external API calls in tests
### Maintain >80% test coverage where feasible

## Performance Guidelines:
### Cache expensive operations using Redis or in-memory solutions
### Use lazy loading where applicable (especially in React)
### Avoid N+1 queries â€” prefer SQL joins or eager loading when using SQLModel

## Cursor-Specific Reminders:
### If refactoring, suggest file splitting once a file reaches ~400 lines
### Suggest modularization if similar logic appears in multiple places
### Prioritize readability and maintainability over clever code
